TODO:
- add player name for the character
- get scene IDs from OBS (driven by the name of the character, dice is hardset?)
- User token regeneration (expires after 4 hours?)
- figure out how to send messages back to the channel from inside other functions
- Test all this shit
- Documentation and clean stuff up
- Force audio stop for spammed voice chats that are too lengthy
- Performance testing with large user base or with multiple characters all talking at the same time
